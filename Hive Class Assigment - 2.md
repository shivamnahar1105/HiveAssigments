#### 1. Will the reducer work or not if you use “Limit 1” in any HiveQL query?

Using "LIMIT 1" in a HiveQL query can affect the behavior of the reducer, depending on the specific query and the underlying data.

When a query contains a "LIMIT 1" clause, it instructs Hive to stop processing the data once it has found the first result that matches the query conditions. This means that Hive will not need to perform a full reduce step, since it only needs to return a single row of data. In this case, the reducer may not be used at all.

However, if the query contains an ORDER BY clause, or if it involves a join or other complex operations, Hive may still need to use the reducer to perform the necessary computations. In this case, the reducer will only process a single chunk of data (typically 128MB by default) at a time, but it will still be used.

So in summary, whether the reducer will be used or not when using "LIMIT 1" in a HiveQL query depends on the specific query and the underlying data. In some cases, the reducer may not be needed, but in other cases, it may still be used to perform the necessary computations.

#### 2. Suppose I have installed Apache Hive on top of my Hadoop cluster using default metastore configuration. Then, what will happen if we have multiple clients trying to access Hive at the same time? 

If you have installed Apache Hive on top of your Hadoop cluster using default metastore configuration, multiple clients trying to access Hive at the same time can potentially create resource contention issues and affect performance.

The default metastore configuration in Hive uses a local derby database, which is not designed for high concurrency or high availability scenarios. This means that multiple clients trying to access the same metastore database simultaneously can cause locks and other synchronization issues, leading to slow response times and potential data inconsistencies.

To mitigate these issues, you can consider using a shared metastore database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which are designed for higher concurrency and can provide better performance and scalability. Additionally, you can also consider using a load balancer to distribute the client requests across multiple Hive servers to handle the incoming requests more efficiently.

Another option is to use Hive Server 2, which provides a more scalable and concurrent architecture for handling multiple client requests. Hive Server 2 can support multiple clients accessing the same metastore database and can handle the incoming requests using a pool of worker threads, thereby improving the overall performance and concurrency of the system.

#### 3. Suppose, I create a table that contains details of all the transactions done by the customers: CREATE TABLE transaction_details (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, month STRING, country STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ; Now, after inserting 50,000 records in this table, I want to know the total revenue generated for each month. But, Hive is taking too much time in processing this query. How will you solve this problem and list the steps that I will be taking in order to do so?

To optimize the query and improve the processing time, you can consider implementing the following steps:

* Use partitioning: Partitioning the table on the "month" column can help to improve the performance of the query, as Hive can scan only the relevant partition(s) instead of scanning the entire table. You can create the partitioned table using the following command:

```
CREATE TABLE transaction_details_partitioned (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, country STRING)
PARTITIONED BY (month STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ;
```

You can then insert the data into the partitioned table using the following command:

```
INSERT INTO TABLE transaction_details_partitioned PARTITION (month)
SELECT cust_id, amount, country, month FROM transaction_details;
```

* Use bucketing: Bucketing the table on the "month" column can further improve the performance of the query by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned for each bucket. You can create the bucketed table using the following command:

```
CREATE TABLE transaction_details_bucketed (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, country STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (month) INTO 12 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ;
```

You can then insert the data into the bucketed table using the following command:

```
INSERT INTO TABLE transaction_details_bucketed SELECT cust_id, amount, country, month FROM transaction_details;
```

* Use the correct query: To get the total revenue generated for each month, you can use the following query:

```
SELECT month, SUM(amount) as total_revenue FROM transaction_details_partitioned
GROUP BY month;
```

* Tune the configuration: You can also tune the Hive configuration settings to improve the performance of the query. Some of the important settings to consider include:

-- MapReduce parameters such as the number of mappers and reducers

-- Memory allocation parameters such as the heap size and cache size

-- Compression settings such as block size and codec type

-- Tez parameters such as the number of vertices and parallelism

By implementing these steps, you should be able to improve the performance of the query and get the total revenue generated for each month more efficiently.

#### 4.How can you add a new partition for the month December in the above partitioned table?

To add a new partition for the month of December in the above partitioned table "transaction_details_partitioned", you can use the following command:

```
ALTER TABLE transaction_details_partitioned ADD PARTITION (month='December');
```

This command will add a new partition for the month of December in the "transaction_details_partitioned" table. Once the partition is added, you can insert the data for December into the new partition using the following command:

```
INSERT INTO TABLE transaction_details_partitioned PARTITION (month='December')
SELECT cust_id, amount, country FROM transaction_details WHERE month='December';
```

This command will insert the data for the month of December from the "transaction_details" table into the new partition of "transaction_details_partitioned" table.

Note that you should ensure that the partition column values in the insert statement match the partition column names and values specified in the partitioned table.
